"""DuckDB configuration for OTEL span storage.

DuckDB is used for analytics-optimized storage of OpenTelemetry spans.
Unlike SQLite, DuckDB excels at analytical queries on large datasets.

Connection Pattern:
- Use raw duckdb connections for batch inserts (performance)
- Path: /dbdata/duckdb/traces.duckdb (from env)
- Each operation creates its own connection (DuckDB handles concurrency well)

Note: We use raw DuckDB connections instead of SQLAlchemy for performance.
Batch inserts are much faster with duckdb.executemany() than SQLAlchemy ORM.
