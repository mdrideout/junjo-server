# This script is responsible for two things:
# 1. Generating a runtime configuration file for the frontend.
# 2. Displaying a startup message.

# === About This Script ======================================================================
# This script is run when the docker image is built and JUNJO_BUILD_TARGET is "production"
# If you are using a pre-built image from docker hub, the JUNJO_BUILD_TARGET is "production"
#
# This script is responsible for two things:
# 1. Generating a runtime configuration file for the frontend.
# 2. Displaying a startup message.

# === Runtime Configuration ==================================================================
# The production frontend is a static build, so we can't use build-time environment
# variables for configuration that needs to change at runtime. Instead, we
# create a JavaScript file that sets a global configuration object.

# Default FRONTEND_HOST to access the frontend.
FRONTEND_HOST="http://localhost:5153"

# Default API_HOST to localhost for development environments.
API_HOST="http://localhost:1323"

# If running in production, construct the API host from the auth domain.
if [ "$JUNJO_ENV" = "production" ]; then

  # Set the API_HOST and FRONTEND_HOST
  if [ -n "$JUNJO_PROD_AUTH_DOMAIN" ]; then
    FRONTEND_HOST="https://${JUNJO_PROD_AUTH_DOMAIN}"
    API_HOST="https://api.${JUNJO_PROD_AUTH_DOMAIN}"

# Create the config file in the web root.
# This path is based on the `COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html`
# command in the Dockerfile.
CONFIG_FILE="/usr/share/nginx/html/config.js"
echo "window.runtimeConfig = { API_HOST: \"${API_HOST}\" };" > $CONFIG_FILE

# === Startup Message ==========================================================
# ANSI color codes for a nice, colorful output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
BOLD='\033[1m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Use printf for better compatibility and control over newlines

# The main Nginx entrypoint will continue executing after this script.
